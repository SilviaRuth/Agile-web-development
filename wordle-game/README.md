# Wordle Game

This is a simple implementation of the Wordle game, where players have to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the Wordle game interface, including an input field for user guesses, a submit button, and a container to display results.
- `css/styles.css`: Contains the styles for the Wordle game, defining the layout, colors, and fonts used in the application.
- `js/app.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for the Wordle game, handling user input, checking guesses against the correct word, and displaying messages for correct guesses or when the user runs out of guesses.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter your guess in the input field (the word must be 5 letters long).
3. Click the "Submit Guess" button to check your guess.
4. If you guess the word correctly, a success message will be displayed.
5. If you run out of attempts, a message will indicate that you have lost the game.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
